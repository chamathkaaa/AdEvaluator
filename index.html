                  <h3 align="justify"><small> ▪ Attention Analysis </small></h3>
                  <h5 align="justify">Human attention can be various levels in each moment. Usually when a 
                    film is to be 
                    released, some time ago its trailer is release first. The trailer must be able to attract a 
                    large audience. The first impression of the audience should be high about the trailers. 
                    For that, there must be points that need to be brought to the attention of the audience. 
                    The human attention can be in diverse ways on different points. However, the attention 
                    is to be categorized as low, medium, and high. There are previously published research 
                    papers, that classified the attention of the audience into various levels. And 
                    There are researches where analyze the main categories of EEG signals and classify 
                    them according to the main categories of EEG signals Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Theta.
                    “EEG is an instrument for capturing electrical activity in the brain, which also 
                    reflects state of mind. Direct visual observation of EEG signal is exceedingly difficult 
                    due to its low amplitude and its complex pattern. In general, the nature of EEG signal 
                    is non-stationary and random, increasing the complexity in EEG signal analysis”.
                    The combination of mind monitor application and Muse2 device plays vital role at the 
                    initial stage and the ending stage. The most special factor is that the Brain-Computer 
                    Interface does not require external devices or muscle intervention to issue commands 
                    and complete the interaction. The overall idea is delivering an attentiveness 
                    detection with calculating one score for mostly attended level attention for supporting 
                    to make recommendation in real-time.<br></h5>

                    <h3 align="justify"><small> ▪ Emotion Analysis </small></h3>
                    <h5 align="justify">Emotions are a psycho-physiological and conscious experience that is characterized 
                    by intense mental activity and is frequently associated with mood, temperament, 
                    personality, and disposition, and motivation which are essential in everyday human 
                    communication. Emotions can change over time as a result of a person’s experiences. 
                    With the rapid development of technology in recent years, several new applications 
                    for recognizing and analyzing human emotions have been developed. Brain Computer 
                    Interface is a relatively new technology that has advanced in recent years to the point 
                    where a user can capture brain signals using a small brain sensing device. The 
                    frequency of brain signals is an important feature for capturing emotion from EEG. 
                    These frequencies are classified into five groups: alpha, beta, theta, delta, and gamma. 
                    Many studies on emotion analysis with EEG have been conducted in recent years. 
                    Even in most early and recent research, correlation analysis methods were used to 
                    identify patterns in various emotions. Many researchers have already tested various 
                    emotion classification algorithms such as AMGLVQ, Decision Forest, Nave Bayes, 
                    and SVM. Various types of induction methods, such as pictures, music, and films, 
                    have also been used by researchers in previous studies. Using the results of emotion 
                    classification, additional implementations such as movie classification and rating 
                    systems can be created.<br></h5>

                    <h3 align="justify"><small> ▪ Enjoyment Analysis </small></h3>
                    <h5 align="justify">The emotion state "enjoyment," as examined in this study, is terrible about an 
                      advertising and the similarity of the content with the viewers' minds, as well as with a 
                      pleasure and a satisfaction. To intend the overall notion with an emotion such as sad 
                      or joyful, it is quite difficult to quantify a sensation such as enjoyment. A sense of 
                      delight, on the other hand, varies from person to person depending on their probability.
                      With the advancement of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep learning (DL) concepts 
                      paved the path for research in classifying human undergoing emotional states via using 
                      Common Spatial Patterns, and studying intended Deep Neural Network (DNN) 
                      model to reveal the preferences from the EEG signals by using the prepossessed DEAP
                      data-set which is a publicly available database contain with recorded signal data, 
                      frontal face videos for participants, self-reported data from stimuli-volunteers’ and 
                      subjects’ self-assessments. EEG data has been utilized as a unique technique in 
                      numerous prior studies to investigate how emotions develop throughout gaming. 
                      The primary approach that researcher is involved with EEG-based emotion 
                      classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and formats into 
                      spectrogram picture sizes were changed into 224x224x3 in order to categorize that 
                      Neural network. Research depicted a test of hypotheses for probability 
                      distributions across graphs. Non-parametric goodness of fit tests was utilized in 
                      particular for hypotheses for random graph distributions. Eventually, it has been 
                      demonstrated that it is a practical method to isolate specific states of emotion using 
                      EEG with a statistical approach. Because human interests differ from person to person,
                      the system constructed a training sample that implies a general formula for 
                      entertainment feature as an overall distribution in a real time approach.<br></h5>

                      <h3 align="justify"><small> ▪ Recommendation System </small></h3>
                      <h5 align="justify">Recommendation system is an intelligent system that provides the best way to identify 
                        and recommend products based on user’s past behavior. These recommendation 
                        systems will help the users to see only the relevant products according to the preference 
                        and will personalized the sites appropriately. There are several types of 
                        recommendation systems such as Collaborative Filtering, Content Based Filtering,
                        Hybrid Recommendation and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM).
                        Some researches have combined user based and item based Collaborative Filtering to 
                        implement a recommendation system for products and services. Researches have mostly
                        used Content Based Filtering to develop a movie recommendation system based on 
                        user’s similarity. A hybrid approach is a method building a recommendation system 
                        with a combination of two other models. Hybrid Recommendation can built
                        by combining Content Based and Collaborative Filtering to recommend movies for the 
                        users. According to some researches RBM model has used with rating data with the help of 
                        categorical features where RBM considered the number of hidden units which impacts
                        the performance of the model. This experiment has shown better recommendations 
                        than the other models. Recommendation systems can be effective when using the 
                        above-mentioned methods and it is also essential to capture EEG data to see user’s
                        engagement rather than relying on rating data to provide better recommendation 
                        system.<br></h5>

                <div class="tab-pane" id="gap">
                  <h4 class="title">Research Gap</h4>
                  <h5 align="justify">The current approaches for video advertising in the business rely heavily on indicators 
                    such as ratings, likes, and reviews, as well as experts who assess them through surveys. 
                    Because their reviews might be biased and the method, they score is subjective, this 
                    does not always result in proper replies. These types of data collection and analysis 
                    will lead to incorrect conclusions. This suggested technique would analyze a user's 
                    likeliness to a certain movie trailer using EEG brain signals collected from the viewer.
                    Although there have done previously researches related to advertisement evaluation methods there is 
                    no real time video advertisetment evaluation system that evaluate the advertisement using Emotion, 
                    Attention and Enjoyment aspect. Especially using human brain waves. Furthermore, the proposed system 
                    provides rapid feedback about advertising along with the recommendations.

                <div class="tab-pane" id="problem">
                  <h4 class="title">Research Problem</h4>
                  <h5 align="justify">The modern movie/entertainment industry suffers from the limitations of the current 
                    available methods of analyzing film ads (e.g.: movie trailers) before releasing it to the 
                    target audience. Not only is this restricted to the entertainment sector, but it also has 
                    similar consequences in other sectors. Thus, the entertainment industry has gained 
                    more attraction with the popularity of social media sites such as YouTube, which is 
                    also a double-edge sword that can bring good and bad with it.<br>
                    As pre-test techniques and post-test techniques, the current approaches available 
                    for video advertising evaluation can be broken into two key groups. After a video 
                    advertisement is released, post-test methods are used, while pre-test methods are used 
                    before a video advertisement is published. The current pre-test strategies available for 
                    assessing advertising depend on the reviewer's attitude and mentality. This makes it 
                    difficult to trust the outcomes that reviewers give.<br>
                    To demonstrate this, Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes is some websites that collects 
                    film reviewers' reviews. It also invites other people who have seen the film to provide 
                    a review for it. They assess the film as sentimental analysis, where it is sometimes very 
                    dubious whether the film critics offered their honest thoughts. <br>
  
                    The EEG signals are the best and accurate way for measuring emotions that EEG uses 
                    outside of the laboratory and gets into everyday life marketing purposes. Although 
                    comparing to the previous research areas that have discussed attention, emotion and 
                    entertainment analysis using EEG signals in the video advertising evaluation domain, 
                    a smaller number of real-time data streaming studies proposed.<br>
                    The various emotional labels can be plotted at different points on a 2D plane covered 
                    by these two axes. Aside from the 2D model, other researchers have included these 
                    linked action patterns into a 3D emotion model that incorporates various arousals. The 
                    degree to which a person feels unconstrained or in charge of a situation, ranging from 
                    weak to strong.<br>
  
                    So, these kinds of emotions which are identified through this system regarding the 
                    providing a solution for recommendation and evaluation while providing prominent 
                    answers to following research questions from this research study.<br>

                  <h5 align="justify">The main objective of the overall study is to analyze brain waves and build a real-time 
                    system which can evaluate video advertisements and provide recommendation based 
                    on the EEG performance of the audience. The system supports to determine the 
                    willingness of movie/advertisement audience.<br>
                    The study consists of four main components: <br>
                    1) EEG-based emotion identification and performance scoring.<br>
                    2) EEG-based attention assessment and performance scoring.<br>
                    3) Video advertising evaluation based on enjoyment score.<br>
                    4) Advertisement recommendation.

                  <h4 class="title">Methodology</h4>
                  <h3 align="justify"><small> ▪ Environment and Participants </small></h3>
                  <h5 align="justify">Randomly selected 18 movie enthusiasts between the age ranges of 16-34 and ensure 
                  the participants are in a healthy state while excluding individuals who are in pregnancy 
                  state, children or who are suffering from any mental disorders and neurological 
                  abnormalities. All of the participants were in good health and not under the influence 
                  of any drugs. All of the EEG data was gathered in a quiet 
                  environment with lower electrical disturbances.<br></h5>

                  <h3  align="justify"><small> ▪ Data Acquisition using MUSE2 </small></h3>
                  <h5 align="justify">The MUSE2 headband, which has four channels TP9, AF7, AF8, and TP10 to capture 
                  EEG data, was used to capture brain signals related to emotion, attention, and 
                  enjoyment. The Mind Monitor application was used to save the EEG readings into CSV (CommaSeparated Values) file format. Mind Monitor displays absolute values of EEG data 
                  from the sensors in the headband at various frequencies. Data was collected in each 
                  part of the system by attempting various visual activities. <br>
                  According to EEG research, the main focus should be on how brain activity varies in 
                  response to mental assertions and how to identify them properly. 18 movie lovers 
                  between the ages of 16 and 34 were chosen at random and must be in good health, with 
                  the exception of those who are pregnant or are suffering from any mental illnesses or 
                  neurological abnormalities. All of the individuals were in good health and weren't 
                  taking any medications.<br>
                  a) Attention and Emotion Data Acquisition: Data on five emotional states, namely 
                  Happy, Sad, Fear, Satisfying, and Neutral, were collected by showing short 
                  video clips to participants. When a specific clip begins to play, an EEG 
                  recording begins, and markers were placed based on each individual’s 
                  emotions and according to high emotion, moderate emotion and low emotion. 
                  Attention data were gathered same way as emotion data. The markers were 
                  placed according to high, medium, and low attention levels.<br>
                  b) Enjoyment Data Acquisition: For the study determine participants to select 
                  their most favorite advertisement which participants have ever watched for the 
                  purpose of train the sample data from 10 participants.<br>
                  c) Recommendation Data Acquisition: A movie data set along with attention, 
                  emotion and enjoyment scores was created using Movie Lens data set to build
                  the recommendation system. The scores were gathered from the EEG data 
                  when the user is watching the movie trailer.
                  </h5>

                  <h3  align="justify"><small> ▪ Data Pre-Processing </small></h3>
                  <h5 align="justify">Noise and artifacts contaminate EEG signals in general. To increase the quality of the 
                    signal and the accuracy of the desired output, it is critical to prepare EEG to decrease 
                    or eliminate these artifacts. Electronic amplifiers, power line interference, and external 
                    interference all contribute to the noises. These aberrations are mostly caused by 
                    flashing eyes and head, shoulder, knee, and finger movement, which contaminate EEG 
                    signals and spread across many channels. A band pass filter will be used to filter the 
                    brain waves.<br>
                    Filter in the frequency band of 0.5-50 Hz to isolate the data corresponding to the five 
                    rhythms. These filtered out data were categorized into delta (0.5 – 4Hz), theta (4 –
                    8Hz), alpha (8 - 13Hz), beta (13 – 32Hz) and gamma (32Hz and up) Hence sometimes 
                    null values can be occurred in the data set because Muse2 device does not fit well with 
                    some forehead shapes. The EEG data captured and exported include unnecessary sets 
                    of data columns such as data related to eye blinks, jaw clenches, muscles movement, 
                    device accelerometer, device battery power status etc. These immaterial columns and 
                    null value containing rows were removed from the data set.
